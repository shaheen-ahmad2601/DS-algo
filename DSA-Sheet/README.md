# Types of Programming Languages.
- Procedural
- Functional
- Object Oriented.

- Static and dynamic programming languages
int a = "hello" - it will through an error in compile time 
a=10
a="bye" - it will not thorugh error bcoz it does not matter in dynamic programming languages.


# Memory Management - stack memory & heap memory.
 - a=10; - a is reference variable and 10 is object
 - stack memory - a is going to be stroed in stack 
 - heap memory - the value 10 is going to be stroed in heap memory.
 
 - Objects which donot have references variable pointing to them , it will get removed by garbage collection hit the memory.
